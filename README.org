* Description 
  This is a small game to practice clojure. Don't expect too much out of it.
  It is inspired by Chair the Fed by the Federal Reserve of San Francisco (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjSufvlnuXvAhVEr6QKHbdlCwIQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sffed-education.org%2Fchairthefed%2F&usg=AOvVaw1pQvFNu1aSihOchRqO1u6k).
